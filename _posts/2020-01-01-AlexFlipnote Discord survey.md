On my Discord server ~~self promotion xd: [https://discord.gg/DpxkY3x](https://discord.gg/DpxkY3x)~~ I asked you guys to take a small survey to see what you feel about the current state of the server. **23** people responded and I promised to through it, so here we go.

# Do you feel like the server is "Anarchy"?
![ImageCenter](/posts_assets/{{ page.assetsfolder }}/response1.png)

The majority considers the server as (quote on quote) anarchy. Of course I can't call it 100% anarchy, as the server has to follow Discord ToS in order to even be alive today. A few answered no in such case and a few people said a bit more than just either yes or no.

### Custom response 1
> **Purple response:**<br>
> Certainly has some anarchy elements but still complies a lot more with the discord ToS rather than most verified servers.

Yeah, the server does heavily comply with Discord ToS. Reason is, we allow people to go far beyond with their language than other normal Discord server with books of rules. So in order for such server to even exist, we have to be extra careful that all of out members comply with the ToS. That's just how Discord is, otherwise we would go for 100% anarchy and let people say and do whatever.

> **Lightblue response:**<br>
> Mostly yes. The only actual rule is that you don't advertize, which is fine but not anarchy. Also, mods can do whatever they want too, which may create a pressure for some to not behave anarchy-wise to avoid punishment, but that's just an assumption.

I can understand that having "No ads" as the only rule on the server ruins the aspect of being anarchy, however I really don't want people to simply join and post their small, inactive Discord servers and feel entitled to get members from my Discord server that I've worked to grow myself.

Technically mods can do whatever they want indeed, however there are a few limits to what they are allowed to do, in order to keep the server in a stable state without people being afraid to speak. Mostly they comply with Discord ToS and will only do actions according to such, otherwise they mostly ask when they are unsure about something in the `Moderator chat`.

# What do you like about the server?
Here are all the responses.

- How its ran, feels clean (Prizafal#6364)
- Everything possible (Anonymous)
- The idea of freedom within reason. (5ifty#3355)
- i love it, this is the server where i can say anything and no one is like "tf did he just say" like in other servers (all). (soheab_#5757)
- the coffee (Bowser65#0001)
- My custom role is one of the things (Regaus#2811)
- I like how it is super chill and that I can use commands in the general channel. (Ayayai ‚ú®#5846)
- It's cool as frick (PoroLovesSnacks#4269)
- its so fucking cringy (valiyoudumbfuck#1335)
- I actively visit this server, fine server through. (VitalKanev#2348)
- The fascist rulership of the owner. (Whist#6993)
- Its fucking lit broooooo (deüÖ±Ô∏èoxin#0101)
- That I can interact with the owner (Anonymous)
- the community, i'm proud of it<br>the shitposts<br>and how toxic it can be sometimes (HarutoHiroki#4000)
- Being able to be ourselves without much rules holding us back. (ROSEY#0001)
- I like the people, obviously. I really enjoy talking to the people I've met months -and in some cases- more than a year ago. Server wise, I like the laid back attitude of everyone, which is promoted by the 'anarchy' and just gives a good vibe without having to worry about what you say. (VAC Efron#0001)
- i have a role<br><br>the server icon and emojis are cute too (Snazzah#0371)
- Looks fine, but I didn't remember when I joined. (lykakspars#2860)

# What do you hate about the server?
Here are all the responses, all names have been removed and randomised order just in case, don't want people to be targeted...
- No NSFW
- Fucking inactive members just a group of us
- Some toxicity (do not hate it tho), however its discord; what do you expect xD
- the owner
- Good question. Not bothered to take my time to think about the answer tho
- No NSFW for the memes
- just a memory and poro bitch
- The minorities that promote democratic values.(in the server)
- Not enough gachi. Nah jk honestly nothing
- retards that come just to advertise or to annoy people
- I hate that AlexFlipNote doesn't speak a lot hehe x3
- Nothing, really. For more sensitive people I can see how the state of the server can seem unappealing and/or toxic, but once you get to talk to everyone, they're all nice people you can enjoy speding time with. This place isn't toxic at all in my opinion. If you get into trouble, which rarely happens, you know that you're the one who messed up, since you really can't go wrong in a server with barely any rules and with laid back moderation.
- nothing really

### Why is there no NSFW?
I know many of you want NSFW in the server, however I haven't seen a good reason to have such channel on the server. There are good reasons to have such like memes, but it also promotes a lot of hentai, porn and possibly illegal stuff that we have to moderate. If we desire to moderate it, maybe we'll add such channel, otherwise there are no plans to add one now.

# Do you like the current server icon/banner?
Here are the charts of responses, won't say too much about it.

# What's your opinion about the moderation team? (root & sudo)
Here are all the responses, all names have been removed so mods have no one to target if they dislike something. (you're welcome)
- I've never spoken to or seen them
- Lorenz Should be baby mod and the rest is okay i guess
- Epic
- Good mods & admins who are friendly, however 1 or 2 more mods could help in the long run. Also the admin bots a v user friendly.
- bowoser best.
- objectively awesome
- Not good enough cuz I don't have it kappa
- But cool otherwise
- They‚Äôre pretty nice and fair when handling things.
- <span class="alizarin-text">lmao all roots are just fucking cringelord crackheads should get a real job dumb fuck back in my day i had to go to school with no shoes and travel across treacherous terrain every day to get a small about of education, be grateful</span>
- Quiet much. For many people. Meh
- <span class="alizarin-text">They're not doing a bad job but they certainly have gone past the line.</span>
- Pretty chill
- (modz r gey) Yeh they're chill af (gimme sudo, jk)
- Honestly no opinion.. Didn't know that was the moderator team xD
- Root has no perms, lol. As for sudo, they're just chilling like everyone else. They're all good people and take care of problems if they occur every now and then.
- Yep, the mods are good and nice and we can interact with them
- bowser is cool

# Do you feel custom roles is fair for a price of 25‚Ç¨?
Here's the response from all of you, a few where custom, so I will colour them either green for yes, yellow for unsure or red for no, to be easier read.
4 People voted yes, 5 people voted no, let's get to the custom responses.

![ImageCenter](/posts_assets/{{ page.assetsfolder }}/response4.png)

- <span class="emerald-text">custom roles is a meme and the role is more of a nice side effect</span>
- <span class="sun-flower-text">Have never brought a custom role , so have no opinion.</span>
- <span class="alizarin-text">meh, i think its a little expensive but :shrug:</span>
- <span class="sun-flower-text">TOLD YOU!! CAPITALISM!!!</span>
- <span class="sun-flower-text">¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø</span>
- <span class="sun-flower-text">Christmasdeal is the best! Too bad we can only have 1.</span>
- <span class="sun-flower-text">im broke nigga</span>
- <span class="emerald-text">I don't mind paying too much (1 800 rubles!)</span>
- <span class="sun-flower-text">It's relative. In countries with low purchase power it's not. While 25 EUR may be actually a fair price for people from First World, for people from countries of Second World the demand for custom role may be presented, but not satisfied due to inability to afford. It could bring more profit and satisfaction to demand if prices could be adjusted to the earning difference.</span>
- <span class="alizarin-text">Capitalist pig and NO!!!</span>
- <span class="alizarin-text">If its ‚Ç¨25 per role, yes although i can understand why (dont want a bunch of custom roles clogging up server list, altho maybe ‚Ç¨15 is a lil more fair?)</span>
- <span class="emerald-text">I mean, yeah reasonably priced for several reasons</span>
- <span class="alizarin-text">I'd say 10-15 cause it'll attract people more.</span>
- <span class="sun-flower-text">Spend your money on whatever you want. For me, 25 euros for a Discord role is a dumb investment. Maybe it's more of a way to support Alex as a developer?</span>

In total, **7 people** think the price for custom roles is fair/fine, while **9 people** disagree. I can understand that it's a high price to get a custom role on a Discord server, it's simply a role to show support for my projects and return get a nice colour on the server. Possibly I could reduce the price, but it has to still be a bit high in order to keep the custom roles amount in check. Hopefully you understand my reasoning of such. ‚ù§

# What do you think of the leveling system with roles?
Here are all the responses, names are removed just in case.
- nice
- Its good enough
- needs more roles like level 2 and 4 and between others.
- h o w a b o u t n o
- Good as long as I have the highest role on it >:)
- It takes long, but the roles are cool.
- yee sure im not addicted like that one retard regaus
- Fine
- Serves it's role of keeping the server more alive.
- Its neat
- Oooh, me likey
- what comes after lv50 tho?
- I love them. Shows how much life we don't have :)
- Pretty cool, though leveling gets really slow at some point. But for now I'm not having that problem since I was reset, lol.
- ROLES SORTA CONFUSING ME but it‚Äôs ok
- its fine

# What's your opinion on xelA, is the auto-moderation fair? Is XP distributed in a fair matter? etc.
Here are all the respones, names are removed to anonymise reviews to xelA.
- yes
- Yes it is
- yes its perfect.
- doesn't ban often enough, mods dont get enough xp, regaus doesn't get negative amounts of xp
- Yes
- Yes and yes.
- But she sometimes hates me :(
- yea im not addicted so its good
- Good moderation through
- xelA can be kind of bad sometimes it definitely is a little too strict on the auto-moderation part but it's handles the xp system pretty well.
- Yiss
- about auto-moderation, i think xelA should check the time between the user joins and when they send disgusting and retarded ads and user roles when doing so, that way mods doesn't have to come on and manually ban retards who joins just to advertise
- Yes. Keeps the damn trolls out.
- Auto-mod is good as it is. The 3-strikes-out system works well and it does a good job cleaning the place up. Leveling gets too slow eventually, as mentioned before.
- Yup, it‚Äôs alright
- xela is cool, i dont care about leveling all that much

# Do you want the Discord server to run game servers?
![ImageCenter](/posts_assets/{{ page.assetsfolder }}/response5.png)

A lot of you guys want the server to run game servers, for now we got **Minecraft** *(mc.alexflipnote.dev)* which is a start, as I own the domain [festive.community](https://festive.community), I could probably take advantage of that and host a few servers with that domain and name, like the good old days of **Festive Community**.

# Is AlexFlipnote a furry?
![ImageCenter](/posts_assets/{{ page.assetsfolder }}/response6.png)

Not sure why you guys believe I'm a furry, but ok...<br>
~~This was only a joke question for fun, since it's a meme on the Discord server that I'm a furry for some reason.~~

# Anything you would like to add?
Here are the responses from the last question, names will be shown this time, so have fun <3

> you are a furry fuck off<br>
> _**- Anonymous**_

> Ur mom is my wife<br>
> _**- Anonymous**_

> The server is great as it is. I'm just happy it's not an anal server with a wall of rules and complicated systems. Great job on this. Who would imagine a server revolving around yourself would grow like this, right?<br>
> _**- VAC Efron#0001**_

# Conclusion
Thank you everyone for participating in this survey, I will take all feedback provided to consideration and possibly do many, if not all of the suggested feedback. Of course there were a few people who were pretty negative, which is all fine, I will take such in consideration on how we can improve üëç

If you would love to join the server yourself and talk, you can join [here](https://discord.gg/DpxkY3x). Don't be afraid to say anything, however don't expect people to agree on you 24/7 if you have an opinion, they are allowed to criticise you regardless (but not targeted harrasment, so it won't go too far, don't worry).

Hope you had fun reading this, have a great day.
